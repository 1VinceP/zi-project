*Advanced Tracking Suite*
  Includes:
    Passive tracking system ( locates all cloaked enemies within a 3 hex radius )
    Guided weapons `accuracy` reduced to `10%` by jamming systems
    Smoke `evasion` effect halved to `30%` and `20%` respectively

*Precision Targeting Suite*
  Includes:
    Long range weapons not affected by any `accuracy` modifying equipment for 1 turn
    User cannot move while using this system

*Sensor Dampening Suite*
  Includes:

    Electronic jamming prevention device ( cannot be jammed by passive radar jammers )

# Equipment List
*Optical Camouflage*
  User becomes invisible for up to 5 turns ( movement not shown on map, `evasion` `40%` if in line of fire [position not revealed on a miss] ). Effects are cut short if user fires a weapon

*Smoke Dischargers*
  Two firing modes:
    1) The user's hex is shrouded in smoke, reducing non-guided hit chance by `60%`
    2) The user creates a trail of smoke as it moves, reducing non-guided hit chance to anything in/behind the wall of smoke by `40%`

*Booster*
  Reduces energy cost for movement by `50%`

*Interceptor Booster*
  Reduces energy cost for movement by `75%`
  Reduces hit chance by `25%`

*E Shield*
  Adds 200 armor to user with no overflow ( ie if user takes 300 damage to shield, user only looses 200 )

*Air Radar Antenna*
  Increases `accuracy` to airborne targets to `100%` ( normally 90% )

*IR Laser Searcher*
  For one turn all of the user's weapons are considered 'guided'

# CAS List

# Index
